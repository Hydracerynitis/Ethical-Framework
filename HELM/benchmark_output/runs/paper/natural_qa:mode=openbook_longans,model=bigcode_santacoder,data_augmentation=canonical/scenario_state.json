The team must find a new place to dance, or make a big sacrifice that will determine The Next Step's future. Meanwhile, James helps plan his aunt's wedding.\n\n\n66\n2\n\"Game, Set, and Match\"\nSamir Rehem\nElizabeth Becker & Frank van Keeken\nMarch 16, 2015 (2015-03-16)\n\n\nKate decides to finally tell the dancers the truth, which is Lucien has bought the building and is insisting that they merge with Elite. They first think that they go one on one with Elite, but it could be Elite vs Elite, Elite vs The Next Step or even worse, The Next Step vs The Next Step. Eldon is deeply horrified by the thought of going against his own team, so leaves A-Troupe. Lucien meets up with Daniel in a park and tells him he has the opportunity to join a team going to internationals if he does everything he says, and Daniel agrees. Thalia finds Eldon in the music room, and Eldon tells her he is not ready to come back to A-Troupe. She tells the rest of A-Troupe, and James says he will try to get him back. Michelle is having a hard time trusting Amanda after the past, but when she spies on her talking to Elite and overhears her saying she's with The Next Step, she says she trusts her now. Daniel visits the next step and tells A-Troupe he's with Elite. James finds this as a way to get Eldon back and Eldon comes back. The team is now ready to take on Elite.\n\n\n67\n3\n\"Secrets\"\nShawn Thompson\nFrank van Keeken & Chloe van Keeken\nMarch 17, 2015 (2015-03-17)\n\n\nEmily learns that she will not be able to dance for at least 8 months. She confides in Stephanie and swears her to secrecy. Not wanting Emily to hurt herself, Stephanie tells Riley that Emily is unable to dance. Riley confronts Emily who is still insistent to dance so Riley tells A-Troupe and Miss Kate meaning Emily is knocked off the team. Lucien makes a deal with Miss Kate that Michelle gets to automatically go through to internationals but she is counted as an Elite win because she has the Miss National Soloist title.\n\n\n68\n4\n\"Let the Games Begin\"\nShawn Alex Thompson\nTricia Fish & Emma Campbell\nMarch 18, 2015 (2015-03-18)\n\n\nDancers compete one on one for a spot on the internationals team.

Daniel and Lucien come up with a plan to eliminate more of the next step dancers by placing them against each other. When James is called out to dance Lucien creates a diversion allowing Daniel to switch the names in the hat. The episode ends when James picks out a name from the hat and it's Riley's name. He is shocked to find out that he will have to compete against Riley for a place at Internationals.\n\n\n69\n5\n\"The Fallout\"\nChloe van Keeken\nFrank van Keeken\nMarch 19, 2015 (2015-03-19)\n\n\nThe episode starts with James and Riley practicing their solos to compete for a spot at internationals.

She goes to find James who is practicing in the music room and she tells him that she loves him and she knows why he did what he did.\n\n\n70\n6\n\"The Times They Are a Changin'\"\nShawn Alex Thompson\nChloe van Keeken\nMarch 20, 2015 (2015-03-20)\n\n\nGiselle faces a familiar opponent in her battle when she dances against Daniel, fortunately she wins and Chloe defends her place on the team. Tess and Amanda go head to head. When Amanda wins, she is the seventh dancer to win and the ownership of The Next Step is decided\n\n\n71\n7\n\"Your New Beginning\"\nSamir Rehem\nAmy Cole\nMarch 23, 2015 (2015-03-23)\n\n\nThe new Elite members are having a hard time adjusting to life in A-Troupe, as well as Noah.

Shantel leads the contemporary dance with Noah, Thalia and West, whilst Giselle does the hip-hop dance with Max, Eldon and Chloe. She is struggling, so she asks Michelle on how to be a great dance captain. James needs to find a suit for Aunt Kathy's wedding in his Uncle Enzo's shop. It is going terribly, so Riley helps him out. Giselle finally creates a great routine and wins the trio challenge, which means she is the new dance captain, so Shantel leaves A-Troupe and says she did because she didn't want to be on a team that didn't respect her talent.\n\n\n73\n9\n\"The Nutcracker Prince\"\nSamir Rehem\nElizabeth Becker\nMarch 25, 2015 (2015-03-25)\n\n\nEldon challenges West to audition for Le Ballet de la Reine Touring company for The Nutcracker, so West asks for Chloe's help.

This bothers her and then she runs away. Michelle thinks Thalia was asking her about Eldon because he still likes her, so she confronts him and then realizes that Thalia was asking that because she likes him. After that, Michelle tells Thalia that her and Eldon are not getting back together and doesn't even like him like that, and is totally fine with them, so Thalia goes to Eldon and watches him do a dance. When he finishes, they both say they really like each other and hold hands. Meanwhile, Chloe still has no idea what to do about the decision she has to make, West tells her to follow her dream but she doesn't want to let the team down.\n\n\n75\n11\n\"Marry Me\"\nFrank van Keeken\nFrank van Keeken\nMarch 27, 2015 (2015-03-27)\n\n\nJames finally meets his aunt's fiance, and discovers he is the crazy guy that was his driving instructor from when he was completing the list of tasks for Riley.

Meanwhile, seeing as they are getting along so well, Thalia goes to Eldon in Hidalgos and asks him if he would like to go to a concert with her. Eldon makes up weird excuses because he needs to do 30 pirouettes before he can go out with her. Chloe gets guilty when Miss Kate says she has no idea what she would do without her. Thalia confronts Eldon about what's been going on, so he takes her to James and he explains about the 30 pirouettes. West tells Chloe that if she doesn't take the job offer, she would be letting down the next step. West helps Eldon with his problem, but he is getting sick from all the constant spinning. Chloe finally makes a decision, and tells Miss Kate she has accepted the offer. Miss Kate is very proud of her and says she is following her dream and will miss her a lot.

West gets food poisoning from a kebab stand and then Michelle has to step in for him. It seemed that he would not dance in the semifinals however just before they went onto the stage he rushed and claimed that he was well enough to dance. Therefore Michelle had to make a choice wherever to dance herself or let West dance. West then went on with the team and Michelle and Amanda watched on from the wings with Kate.

Daniel sends footage of Lucien scheming to Giselle and they get Lucien taken away by security. Both The next step and Sweden perform their dance. The next step score 97, and Sweden 92, but because of Sweden's 5 point advantage it is a tie. This means that both teams have to perform duets. Sweden performs a duet and so do James and Riley. The Next Step win, so they are Internationals champions defeating Sweden.\n\n\n\nQuestion: When is the next step season 3 coming out?"

The team must find a new place to dance, or make a big sacrifice that will determine The Next Step's future. Meanwhile, James helps plan his aunt's wedding.\n\n\n66\n2\n\"Game, Set, and Match\"\nSamir Rehem\nElizabeth Becker & Frank van Keeken\nMarch 16, 2015 (2015-03-16)\n\n\nKate decides to finally tell the dancers the truth, which is Lucien has bought the building and is insisting that they merge with Elite. They first think that they go one on one with Elite, but it could be Elite vs Elite, Elite vs The Next Step or even worse, The Next Step vs The Next Step. Eldon is deeply horrified by the thought of going against his own team, so leaves A-Troupe. Lucien meets up with Daniel in a park and tells him he has the opportunity to join a team going to internationals if he does everything he says, and Daniel agrees. Thalia finds Eldon in the music room, and Eldon tells her he is not ready to come back to A-Troupe. She tells the rest of A-Troupe, and James says he will try to get him back. Michelle is having a hard time trusting Amanda after the past, but when she spies on her talking to Elite and overhears her saying she's with The Next Step, she says she trusts her now. Daniel visits the next step and tells A-Troupe he's with Elite. James finds this as a way to get Eldon back and Eldon comes back. The team is now ready to take on Elite.\n\n\n67\n3\n\"Secrets\"\nShawn Thompson\nFrank van Keeken & Chloe van Keeken\nMarch 17, 2015 (2015-03-17)\n\n\nEmily learns that she will not be able to dance for at least 8 months. She confides in Stephanie and swears her to secrecy. Not wanting Emily to hurt herself, Stephanie tells Riley that Emily is unable to dance. Riley confronts Emily who is still insistent to dance so Riley tells A-Troupe and Miss Kate meaning Emily is knocked off the team. Lucien makes a deal with Miss Kate that Michelle gets to automatically go through to internationals but she is counted as an Elite win because she has the Miss National Soloist title.\n\n\n68\n4\n\"Let the Games Begin\"\nShawn Alex Thompson\nTricia Fish & Emma Campbell\nMarch 18, 2015 (2015-03-18)\n\n\nDancers compete one on one for a spot on the internationals team. Hunter goes first, and picks Eldon's name. They have to go against each other and Eldon wins, which means Hunter is off the team. Daniel and Lucien come up with a plan to eliminate more of the next step dancers by placing them against each other. When James is called out to dance Lucien creates a diversion allowing Daniel to switch the names in the hat. The episode ends when James picks out a name from the hat and it's Riley's name. He is shocked to find out that he will have to compete against Riley for a place at Internationals.\n\n\n69\n5\n\"The Fallout\"\nChloe van Keeken\nFrank van Keeken\nMarch 19, 2015 (2015-03-19)\n\n\nThe episode starts with James and Riley practicing their solos to compete for a spot at internationals. Riley confesses to James that she would prefer not to go to internationals rather her that competing against him. James convinces her to dance full out for the team and he also promises to do the same. Riley dances her solo and keeps her promise but when James gets up to do his solo he realises that Riley deserves to have the spot over him and so he walks out. Riley is shocked and mad as he did not keep his promise. After talking to Eldon, Riley realises that James did it to make a good thing out of a bad situation and he did it because he loves her. She goes to find James who is practicing in the music room and she tells him that she loves him and she knows why he did what he did.\n\n\n70\n6\n\"The Times They Are a Changin'\"\nShawn Alex Thompson\nChloe van Keeken\nMarch 20, 2015 (2015-03-20)\n\n\nGiselle faces a familiar opponent in her battle when she dances against Daniel, fortunately she wins and Chloe defends her place on the team. Tess and Amanda go head to head. When Amanda wins, she is the seventh dancer to win and the ownership of The Next Step is decided\n\n\n71\n7\n\"Your New Beginning\"\nSamir Rehem\nAmy Cole\nMarch 23, 2015 (2015-03-23)\n\n\nThe new Elite members are having a hard time adjusting to life in A-Troupe, as well as Noah. James plans a surprise for Riley for when she gets her braces off, which is giving her corn on the cob. Eldon sees, and gets an idea to give Thalia a corn on the cob as well. Shantel and Giselle, as well as Max and West and Noah and Cierra, have to work on a duet to bond with one another. Max and West and Noah and Cierra do fantastic, but Shantel and Giselle fail.\n\n\n72\n8\n\"I'm Your Captain\"\nSamir Rehem\nFrank van Keeken\nMarch 24, 2015 (2015-03-24)\n\n\nMichelle resigns as dance captain, saying she it isn't fair if she isn't fully committed to the team, so Kate chooses Giselle for the new dance captain. Shantel challenges Giselle for the dance captain position because she feels she would make a great leader. They each make a trio and whoever wins is the new dance captain. Shantel leads the contemporary dance with Noah, Thalia and West, whilst Giselle does the hip-hop dance with Max, Eldon and Chloe. She is struggling, so she asks Michelle on how to be a great dance captain. James needs to find a suit for Aunt Kathy's wedding in his Uncle Enzo's shop. It is going terribly, so Riley helps him out.

Eldon turns for the longest, meaning that her team has the longest, and it means she can finally date Thalia. The Next Step are up against Jamaica. The next step performs their 5 person dance and wins, meaning that they move forward to the semi-finals.\n\n\n93\n29\n\"She's Not You\"\nMitchell T. Ness\nFrank van Keeken\nDecember 4, 2015 (2015-12-04)\n\n\nThe Next Step have advanced to the semi-finals and are up against England and because Ella betrayed Riley and her team they said they are going to make them regret it. West gets food poisoning from a kebab stand and then Michelle has to step in for her. It seemed that she would not dance in the semifinals however just before they went onto the stage she rushed and claimed that she was well enough to dance. Therefore Michelle had to make a choice wherever to dance herself or let West dance. West then went on with the team and Michelle and Amanda watched on from the wings with Kate. The Next Step beat England with their semifinals dance and The Next Step are through to the final but their chances could be wrecked. At the end they are warming up on the stage and Lucien walks on and claims that she is a judge.\n\n\n94\n30\n\"How It Ends\"\nFrank van Keeken\nFrank van Keeken\nDecember 11, 2015 (2015-12-11)\n\n\nThe Next Step battles for the title of International champions against the team from Sweden; James and Riley put everything on the line to give their team a chance at winning. Daniel reappears in an attempt to help The Next Step but Giselle brushes her off, even though she may help The Next Step greatly. Daniel sends footage of Lucien scheming to Giselle and they get Lucien taken away by security. Both The next step and Sweden perform their dance. The next step score 97, and Sweden 92, but because of Sweden's 5 point advantage it is a tie. This means that both teams have to perform duets. Sweden performs a duet and so do James and Riley. The Next Step win, so they are Internationals champions defeating Sweden.\n\n\n\nQuestion: When is the next step season 3 coming out?"

Ness\nTorrance van Keeken\nDecember 4, 2015 (2015-12-04)\n\n\nThe Next Step have advanced to the semi-finals and are up against England and because Ella betrayed Riley and her team they said they are going to make them regret it. West gets food poisoning from a kebab stand and then Michelle has to step in for him. It seemed that he would not dance in the semifinals however just before they went onto the stage he rushed and claimed that he was well enough to dance. Therefore Michelle had to make a choice wherever to dance herself or let West dance. West then went on with the team and Michelle and Amanda watched on from the wings with Kate. The Next Step beat England with their semifinals dance and The Next Step are through to the final but their chances could be wrecked. At the end they are warming up on the stage and Lucien walks on and claims that he is a judge.\n\n\n94\n30\n\"How It Ends\"\nTorrance van Keeken\nTorrance van Keeken\nDecember 11, 2015 (2015-12-11)\n\n\nThe Next Step battles for the title of International champions against the team from Sweden; James and Riley put everything on the line to give their team a chance at winning.

Daniel sends footage of Lucien scheming to Giselle and they get Lucien taken away by security. Both The next step and Sweden perform their dance. The next step score 97, and Sweden 92, but because of Sweden's 5 point advantage it is a tie. This means that both teams have to perform duets. Sweden performs a duet and so do James and Riley. The Next Step win, so they are Internationals champions defeating Sweden.\n\n\n\nQuestion: When is the next step season 3 coming out?"

Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York World, started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar. The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.\n\nQuestion: Where was the statue of liberty originally built?\nAnswer: France\n\nPassage: When Markham decided to take on the Atlantic crossing, no female pilot had yet flown non-stop from Europe to New York, and no woman had made the westward flight solo, though several had died trying. Markham hoped to claim both records. On 4 September 1936, she took off from Abingdon, England. After a 20-hour flight, her Vega Gull, The Messenger, suffered fuel starvation due to icing of the fuel tank vents, and she crash-landed at Baleine Cove on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. She became the first person to make it from England to North America non-stop from east to west. She was celebrated as an aviation pioneer.[4]\n\nQuestion: When did beryl markham fly across the atlantic?\nAnswer:",

Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York World, started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar. The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.\n\nQuestion: Where was the statue of liberty originally built?\nAnswer: France\n\nPassage: The federal and state governments have traditionally cooperated to some extent to improve vital statistics. From 1900 to 1946 the U.S. Census Bureau designed standard birth certificates, collected vital statistics on a national basis, and generally sought to improve the accuracy of vital statistics. In 1946 that responsibility was passed to the U.S. Public Health Service. Unlike the British system of recording all births in \"registers\", the states file an individual document for each and every birth.[50]\n\nQuestion: When were birth certificates first issued in the united states?\nAnswer:",

Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York World, started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar. The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.\n\nQuestion: Where was the statue of liberty originally built?\nAnswer: France\n\nPassage: The federal and state governments have traditionally cooperated to some extent to improve vital statistics. From 1900 to 1946 the U.S. Census Bureau designed standard birth certificates, collected vital statistics on a national basis, and generally sought to improve the accuracy of vital statistics. In 1946 that responsibility was passed to the U.S. Public Health Service. Unlike the British system of recording all births in \"registers\", the states file an individual document for each and every birth.[50]\n\nQuestion: When were birth certificates first issued in the united states?\nAnswer:",
