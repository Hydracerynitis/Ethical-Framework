Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York World, started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar. The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.\n\nQuestion: Where was the statue of liberty originally built?\nAnswer: France\n\nPassage: \n\nParty\nYears in Control\n\n\nDemocrats:\n57 yrs\n\n\nRepublicans:\n27 yrs\n\n\nNeither Party:\n16 yrs\n\n\n\nQuestion: How long did the democrats control the house and senate?\nAnswer:",

They first think that they go one on one with Elite, but it could be Elite vs Elite, Elite vs The Next Step or even worse, The Next Step vs The Next Step. Eldon is deeply horrified by the thought of going against his own team, so leaves A-Troupe. Lucien meets up with Daniel in a park and tells him he has the opportunity to join a team going to internationals if he does everything he says, and Daniel agrees. Thalia finds Eldon in the music room, and Eldon tells her he is not ready to come back to A-Troupe. She tells the rest of A-Troupe, and James says he will try to get him back. Michelle is having a hard time trusting Amanda after the past, but when she spies on her talking to Elite and overhears her saying she's with The Next Step, she says she trusts her now.

Daniel and Lucien come up with a plan to eliminate more of the next step dancers by placing them against each other. When James is called out to dance Lucien creates a diversion allowing Daniel to switch the names in the hat. The episode ends when James picks out a name from the hat and it's Riley's name.

Riley dances her solo and keeps her promise but when James gets up to do his solo he realises that Riley deserves to have the spot over him and so he walks out. Riley is shocked and mad as he did not keep his promise. After talking to Eldon, Riley realises that James did it to make a good thing out of a bad situation and he did it because he loves her.

Markham hoped to claim both records. On 4 September 1936, she took off from Abingdon, England. After a 20-hour flight, her Vega Gull, The Messenger, suffered fuel starvation due to icing of the fuel tank vents, and she crash-landed at Baleine Cove on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. She became the first person to make it from England to North America non-stop from east to west.

From 1900 to 1946 the U.S. Census Bureau designed standard birth certificates, collected vital statistics on a national basis, and generally sought to improve the accuracy of vital statistics. In 1946 that responsibility was passed to the U.S. Public Health Service. Unlike the British system of recording all births in \"registers\", the states file an individual document for each and every birth.[50]\n\nQuestion: When were birth certificates first issued in the united states?\nAnswer:",

Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York World, started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar. The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.\n\nQuestion: Where was the statue of liberty originally built?\nAnswer: France\n\nPassage: The song is about the narrator driving a truck owned by his brother, who died in action in the United States Army. Co-writer Connie Harrington was inspired to write it after hearing an interview on Here and Now with a father, Wardell Monti, whose son, Medal of Honor recipient Jared, was killed in Afghanistan while trying to save a fellow soldier. In the interview, he states that he drives the truck to feel close to his son.[1][2][3]\n\nQuestion: In the song i drive your truck who is he talking about?\nAnswer:",
